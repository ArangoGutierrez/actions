# GitHub Actions for Singularity

This repository will provide Github Action for Singularity containers. @vsoch
is just learning about actions so this is a work in progress.

## What do I see here?

Each action is a subdirectory here. For usage details, see the README file in
the respective directories. The directory names refer to Singularity versions,
but you probably already figured that out.
